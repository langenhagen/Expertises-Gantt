# Gantt Chart for My Languages and technologies.
author: langenhagen
version 170611


Nice Javascript visualisation of the languages and APIs I used and use
according to the years when I used them.
It is based on a modified version of the gantt chart library from

https://github.com/dk8996/Gantt-Chart

which in turn is based on d3 (https://d3js.org/).

By now, a little transformation code from what the context of My data is to what the
Gantt chart library anticipates is inside My javascript code.

## TODO:

- write Number of years into each entry field.
- Make one complete version, and make one concise version
