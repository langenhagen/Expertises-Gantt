# Gantt Chart for My Languages and technologies.
author: langenhagen
version 170527


Nice Javascript visualisation of the languages and APIs I used and use
according to the years when I used them.
It is based on a modified version of the  gantt chart library from

https://github.com/dk8996/Gantt-Chart

which in turn is based on d3 (https://d3js.org/).


It is by far not perfect but the Gantt Chart library can be refactored for a more convient usage.
By now, a little transformation code from what the context of My data is to what the
Gantt chart library anticipates is inside My javascript code.

## TODO:
make CSS nice
