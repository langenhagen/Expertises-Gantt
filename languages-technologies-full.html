            The following diagram shows what I did when in my career as a computer scientist
            and software engineer.<br>
            It depicts the few stages of my career such as
            <span class="bar-education">educational facilities</span>
            and <span class="bar-work">workplaces</span>
            as well as the computer <span class="bar-language">languages</span>
            and <span class="bar-technology">technologies</span>
            I have worked with and with which I spent a considerable amount of practice and time.<br>
            This is a more or less complete listing which I keep for my private record.<br>
            Use Chrome to view the chart. Apparently, Firefox has an issue with the gantt chart CSS.
