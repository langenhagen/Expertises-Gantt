# Gantt Chart for My Languages and technologies.
author: langenhagen
version 170611


Nice Javascript visualisation of the languages and APIs I used and use
according to the years when I used them.
It is based on the gantt chart approach from Dimitry Kudrayvtsev (github.com/dk8996/Gantt-Chart)
and d3 (https://d3js.org/).

By now, a little transformation code from what the context of My data is to what the
Gantt chart library anticipates is inside My javascript code.

## TODO:

- Make one complete version, and make one concise version
